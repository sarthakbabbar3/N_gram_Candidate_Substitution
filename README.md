# N_gram_Candidate_Substitution
Correcting preposition mistake using a n-gram candidate substitution approach. In a test sentence, n-gram containing prepositions are extracted. The preposition is replaced by all possible candidates. The candidate with the best score is chosen.
As the value of n increased, we observed an increase in precision, but also a decrease in recall.
